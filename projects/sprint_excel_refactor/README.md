# Sprint Financial ETL

This project standardizes, merges, and analyzes Sprint Planning, Teamwork Time Logs, and Unearned Revenue financial
data.

It loads, parses, cleans, and aligns multiple messy real-world data sources into unified, exportable datasets ‚Äî
supporting financial reporting and sprint planning reviews.

## üßπ Data Processing

- **Client Name Standardization:** Aligns naming inconsistencies across datasets (internal vs external names).
- **User Name Standardization:** Matches user names across different platforms.
- **Sprint Parsing:** Breaks sprint pod goals by week.
- **Objective Parsing:** Identifies actions and services based on project naming patterns.
- **Data Merging:** Links Sprint Planning and Teamwork logs by matched project information.

## ‚ú® Features

- Handles missing and inconsistent values gracefully.
- Modular design: easy to swap in new datasets.
- Exports ready-to-use CSVs for reporting, dashboards, or finance review.

## üõ† Future Improvements (Stretch Goals)

- Add CLI arguments for file paths and date ranges.
- Add validation checks for missing columns or malformed files.
- Create dashboard visualizations from merged data.
