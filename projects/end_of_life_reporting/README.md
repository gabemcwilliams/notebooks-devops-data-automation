# End of Life OS Report Generator

## Overview

This utility generates a clean, professional report of devices reaching end of support (End of Life) based on device inventory data. It loads an inventory dataset, filters for devices nearing or past end of support dates, and outputs a formatted HTML report that can optionally be exported to PDF.

It is **not** a web application, but simply uses **Jinja2** templating for offline report generation.

---

## Features

- **Input:** Reads from a Datto RMM device inventory exported to Excel (`.xlsx`).
- **Processing:**
  - Filters devices based on "end of support" flags.
  - Supports site-specific filtering (e.g., reports per client).
  - Summarizes device categories.
- **Output:**
  - Generates a clean, stylized **HTML** report using a Jinja2 template.
  - Optionally exports to **PDF** using `pdfkit` and `wkhtmltopdf`.
