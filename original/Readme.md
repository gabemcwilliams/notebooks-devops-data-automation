## Some basic guidelines for this repo:
 
* Don't delete code files unless they are no longer needed
* Ensure that all pull requests have proper review before merge
* Master is always our source of truth and we should not push directly to it, always merge request from a feature branch
* If we have a new category for code, create a folder that follows that category with discription Readme.md file (see #readme_standard)
